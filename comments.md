# Comments

Comments can be added in a file in two ways:

1. Single line comments

2. Multi line comments

## Single line comments

Single line comments are added using the `//` symbol. Anything after the `//` symbol is considered a comment.

```js

"Hello World" // This is a comment

```

## Multi line comments

Multi line comments are added using the `/*` and `*/` symbols. Anything between the `/*` and `*/` symbols is considered a comment.

```js

/* 
    This is a comment
    This is also a comment
    This is also a comment 
*/

```

You can nest multi line comments.

```

/* 
    This is a comment

   /* This is also a comment */
   
    This is also a comment 
*/

```
